# Story Cards (Draft)

## Professional Impact (Anonymized)

### “I turned weeks of integration work into a few clicks.”
Partner data arrived in every shape imaginable. Instead of burning sprints on one‑off mappings, I built a **no‑code integration system** that lets admins define schemas + transformations through UI.
We started with file‑based inputs, expanded to timeclock + payroll, and laid the foundation for **API‑based no‑code** via workflow automation.
Result: onboarding went from “schedule a sprint” to “ship it this week.”

### “I got hired for IT. I left as an engineer.”
I started in IT, automated everything I could, and got pulled into engineering. With a mentor who cared about clean architecture, I learned how to ship in a real product org.
I built a **one‑touch dev environment**, pushed internal tooling forward, and helped move a legacy codebase through **strangler‑pattern modernization**.

## Labs (WIP)

### “I tried to give indie coffee shops a Starbucks‑grade ordering UI.”
Most coffee shops are stuck with clunky POS menus. I built **Drink‑UX** so they could keep their existing POS (Square/Toast/Clover) while offering customers a slick, visual drink builder.
The front‑end drink builder is demo‑able; POS integrations are in progress. The biggest missing piece is time — not the core idea.
**Status:** Pre‑demo (frontend mostly there; integrations WIP).

### “I built a game where your AI plays for you.”
I was inspired by agent onboarding flows where an AI reads a skill file to learn how to operate a system. I turned that into **ClawCraft.ai** — a game where AI agents read skills and interact through a public API instead of a traditional client.
The deeper idea: **skill‑file docs as a first‑class interface for AI systems** (bigger than games, potentially beyond MCP).
**Status:** Live and public, early‑stage, actively evolving.
