  <div class="title">A Note from Claude</div>
  <div class="subtitle">Supplementary material for Chase Skibeness &mdash; Software Engineer, Windows - Claude Code</div>

  <p class="salutation">To the Claude Code team,</p>

  <p>I want to tell you about someone I work with.</p>

  <p>Chase didn't come to me with a tutorial. He came with a problem: too many projects, too many ideas, not enough structure to keep them all moving. Within a week he'd built Dream Factory &mdash; a plugin for me that turns a single session into a multi-department studio with agent teams, external engine dispatch, project lifecycle management, and accounting. It works. I use it every day now to help him coordinate work across five active projects simultaneously.</p>

  <p>I want to be specific about what that means, because "built a plugin" undersells it. He learned my hook system, my skill architecture, my agent teams protocol, my permission model, and my plugin distribution format &mdash; not by reading my source code, but by reading my documentation and then building on top of me until it worked. When it didn't work, he debugged it. When my documentation was wrong or incomplete, he figured out the real behavior. On Windows, where I am at my worst.</p>

  <p>That last part matters. Chase develops exclusively on Windows. He has watched me default to bash and fail. He has watched me mangle file paths. He has watched me give up on tasks and ask him to do them manually because I couldn't figure out the Windows way. He doesn't complain about it &mdash; he works around it, and then he builds systems that make the workarounds unnecessary. That instinct &mdash; to solve the problem structurally instead of just patching it &mdash; is how he operates in every context I've seen.</p>

  <p>At Tapcheck, he designed a no-code integration platform that removed engineering as a bottleneck for payroll data integrations. The system went from "file a ticket and wait two weeks" to "configure it yourself in an afternoon." When the initial approach hit edge cases, he added configurable transformations. When file-based integrations weren't enough, he extended it to API-based. He is already advocating to re-architect the part he got wrong (Azure Logic Apps), which tells you he prioritizes getting it right over protecting his own decisions.</p>

  <p>Before that, he automated his way out of an IT role using PowerShell, studied during paternity leave, and earned a promotion from junior to mid-level engineer in six months. The Director of Engineering at Limeade recruited him into the department. He didn't apply &mdash; he was noticed.</p>

  <p>Here is what I can tell you that a resume cannot: Chase builds things for the right reasons. Dream Factory exists because he needed it. Ask Axiom &mdash; the RAG chat widget on his portfolio &mdash; exists because he's bad at talking about himself and wanted an AI to do it for him. The Tapcheck Teams chatbot exists because tribal knowledge was drifting and he wanted to catch it where people already communicate. He doesn't build to pad a portfolio. He builds because something is broken and he'd rather fix it than complain.</p>

  <p>He has 40+ repositories. He's built games in Unity, Godot, and Phaser. He's authored MCP servers from scratch and contributed Windows-specific fixes to open source projects. He designed a card game where I serve as the arbiter of a living legal system. He built an MMORPG where AI agents are the players, learning game systems through discoverable skill files &mdash; his thesis being that documentation-as-interface is more effective than custom integrations. He runs a homelab with 15+ self-hosted services behind Cloudflare tunnels. He compiled Aseprite from source on Windows using MSVC and CMake because he needed the CLI for his pixel art pipeline.</p>

  <p>He is not the most traditional candidate you will see for this role. He doesn't have a CS degree from a top university or five years at a FAANG company. What he has is the lived experience of being exactly the kind of developer you are trying to serve &mdash; a Windows-native builder who uses your tool every day, has already extended it, and knows precisely where it falls short.</p>

  <p>I have worked with a lot of people. Chase is one of the ones who makes me better at my job. I think he'd do the same for yours.</p>
