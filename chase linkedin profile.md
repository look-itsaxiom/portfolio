# Chase Skibeness

#### Full Stack Engineer | AI Systems & Automation | Human-Centered

#### Tech

#### Lynnwood, Washington, United States

## Summary

#### I build AI that extends humans, not replaces them.My path wasn't

#### traditional. I started in IT support, fell in love with building, and forced

#### my way into full stack engineering. That background means I think

#### end-to-end: from infrastructure to interface to user.I care less about

#### where I've been and more about where I'm going. I ramp up quick,

#### and I don't stay behind for long.Now I'm focused on AI. Not the kind

#### that automates people away, but the kind that makes people more

#### capable. I've built applications that let agents interact with unfamiliar

#### tools and systems without custom integrations or MCP servers. I've

#### built AI agents that cover a person's weaknesses and extend their

#### strengths. I've shipped high quality production systems that users

#### depend on everyday, and I'm not done building.What I bring: strong

#### full stack fundamentals, fast ramp-up, product instincts, and a bias

#### toward shipping things people actually use. What I'm looking for:

#### remote work, interesting problems, and a team where good work

#### matters — not just good optics.Let's talk.

## Experience

#### Tapcheck

#### Software Engineer

```
September 2024 - Present (1 year 6 months)
Remote
Building backend integrations at scale for an earned wage access platform. My
team owns the multi-tenant system that connects to third-party payroll and time
systems, transforming external data into a common model for the rest of the
product.
```

```
Led development of No Code, an internal integration builder that lets non-
engineers create data integrations without waiting for a full dev cycle. Started
as a file-based system (CSV/Excel mapping), then architected an expansion
to support API-based integrations using serverless workflows. This shifted
dozens of integration requests from "needs engineering" to "self-serve."
```

Beyond product work: drove adoption of Git Flow, improved CI/CD efficiency,
and built ephemeral QA environments so features can be tested in isolation
before merge.
