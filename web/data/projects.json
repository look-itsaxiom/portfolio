    "story": "Partner data arrived in every shape imaginable. Instead of burning sprints on one-off mappings, we built a full-stack no-code system inside the back-of-house admin app that lets admins define schemas and transformations. It started with file-based timeclock integrations, expanded to file-based payroll, and grew into a richer transformation system so more integrations could be delivered via no-code. Most recently, we shipped the No Code API to enable API-based timeclock and payroll integrations (powered by Azure Logic Apps).",
