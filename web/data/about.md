title: "About Chase"
summary: "I build systems that remove operational friction and explore AI-native experiences."
principles:
  - "Lead with clarity: define the problem before writing code."
  - "Design for operators, not just for happy-path users."
  - "Ship small, learn fast, iterate with intent."
  - "Automate the boring parts so humans can focus on the creative ones."
  - "Treat documentation as product UX, not an afterthought."

I’m Chase — a systems‑minded engineer who loves making complex things feel simple.
My professional work focuses on product‑grade platforms that reduce operational friction. In the lab, I explore AI‑native interfaces and playful experiments that hint at what software feels like when agents are first‑class users.

I’m most at home when I can connect product, design, and engineering into one coherent system. If there’s a bottleneck, I want to unstick it. If there’s a repetitive workflow, I want to eliminate it. If there’s a new interface frontier, I want to prototype it.
