title: "About Chase"
summary: "Systems-minded engineer who started in IT, automated everything in sight, and got pulled into software engineering. Now builds product-grade platforms at work and AI-native experiments in the lab."
principles:
  - "Lead with clarity: define the problem before writing code."
  - "Design for operators, not just for happy-path users."
  - "Ship small, learn fast, iterate with intent."
  - "Automate the boring parts so humans can focus on the creative ones."
  - "Treat documentation as product UX, not an afterthought."

Chase got into tech the way a lot of people do — through a helpdesk. At HD Fowler and then Groupon, they became known as "the scripting person," automating ticket workflows, inventory management, and anything else that felt like it should have been automated already. Every job they touched got a little more efficient, and every script they wrote got a little more ambitious.

The pivot happened at Limeade. Chase was running PowerShell automation across Windows and macOS environments — laptop provisioning, Azure Functions, device management — when the Director of Engineering noticed and asked if they'd considered software engineering. Chase had tried CS coursework years earlier and dropped it. But with a newborn in 2021, they used paternity leave to study JavaScript, Ruby, and Python. They came back, transitioned into the engineering department, and were promoted from junior to associate engineer within six months for consistently delivering at a mid-level pace.

At Limeade, Chase led a greenfield admin rebuild in React, executed a strangler-pattern migration that improved load times by 75-115%, and evangelized a shared design system across engineering and UX. At Tapcheck, they designed and built a No Code integration platform serving 250+ payroll and timeclock systems — turning what used to require full engineering sprints into something admins could configure themselves. They also introduced Git Flow, split CI/CD pipelines, and are building an internal AI knowledge chatbot deployed where people already work.

Outside of work, Chase is a prolific builder — 40+ repositories spanning games, SaaS platforms, AI tools, and creative pipelines. They enforce a 5-project active limit on themselves (that's what Dream Factory is for). Current projects include Millennium (a card game where an AI arbiter builds common law through play), ClawCraft.ai (an MMORPG designed for AI agents), and Ask Axiom (the chatbot on this very site). The common thread: every project either solves a real problem or explores what software looks like when AI is a first-class participant.

Chase believes AI is this generation's touchscreen moment — a fundamentally new way for humans to interact with complex systems through natural language. But their position is clear: AI should raise the competence floor for everybody, not replace the people standing on it. Every AI system they build — Dream Factory, Ask Axiom, the Tapcheck knowledge chatbot — is designed to extend what a person can do, not to remove the person from the equation.
