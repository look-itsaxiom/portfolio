Partner data arrived in every shape imaginable. Instead of burning sprints on one‑off mappings, Chase and team built a no‑code integration system that let admins define schemas and transformations through UI. The work started with file‑based inputs, expanded into timeclock and payroll integrations, and paved the path for API‑driven workflows. The result: onboarding went from “schedule a sprint” to “ship it this week.”
