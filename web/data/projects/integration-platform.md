Partner data arrived in every shape imaginable. Instead of burning sprints on one-off mappings, Chase and team built a **full-stack** no-code capability inside the back-of-house admin app — not just a UI. It started with **file-based timeclock** integrations, expanded to **file-based payroll**, and then grew a richer transformation system so more integrations could be delivered via no-code instead of engineering.

Most recently, the team shipped the **No Code API**, which enables **API-based** timeclock and payroll integrations (not just file uploads). Azure Logic Apps powers that API-driven flow.
