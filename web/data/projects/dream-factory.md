Dream Factory is a Claude Code plugin that organizes a single session into a multi-department studio. Engineering, art, R&D, game dev, accounting — each department has its own tools, context, and delegation patterns. Agent Teams handle parallel work, and external AI engines (Codex CLI, Gemini CLI) get dispatched as specialized workers. Built in under a week because managing five creative projects from one terminal was getting out of hand.
