# FlowNote

## What It Is
FlowNote is a note-taking application where calculations live inline with your text. Write a note, drop in a formula, and results update as you type. The idea is that notes and calculations shouldn't live in separate tools — they should flow together naturally.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Vite (TypeScript)
- **Backend**: Express + Firebase
- **Tests**: 222 tests, all passing, green build

## Current State
On hold while other projects are active. The core functionality works — inline calculations, note management, real-time updates. The codebase is clean with good test coverage. Chase plans to return to it when bandwidth opens up.

## Why It Exists
Chase builds tools that solve problems they personally encounter. FlowNote came from the frustration of switching between a notes app and a calculator/spreadsheet when doing anything that involved both text and numbers.
