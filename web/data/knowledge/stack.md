- PWA (Progressive Web Apps)
- Accessibility (WCAG AA compliance)
- Ionic / Capacitor (mobile hybrid apps)

## Backend
- Node.js
- Express
- Fastify
- NestJS
- .NET Core (professional microservices work)
- REST API design
- PostgreSQL
- SQL Server (professional work)
- MongoDB (used in ClawCraft)

- **Ren'Py** — narrative games
- Pixel art pipelines, sprite sheet automation, AI art generation

## AI & Agent Systems
- AI SDK (Vercel AI SDK)
- OpenRouter (multi-model LLM routing)
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- Vector databases (Qdrant)
- Embeddings (Ollama, nomic-embed-text)
- MCP Protocol (built servers from scratch — Layer.ai, ComfyUI contributions)
- Claude Code (daily driver + plugin author)
- Multi-agent orchestration (Claude as orchestrator, Codex CLI + Gemini CLI as workers)
- Skill-file architecture (documentation as agent interface)
- Prompt engineering (department-specific templates, arbiter prompts, spawn prompts)

## Infrastructure & DevOps
- Docker & Docker Compose (deployments, homelab)
- Cloudflare Tunnels (public access to self-hosted services)
- Self-hosted homelab (15+ services)
- Git / Git Flow
- CI/CD (split pre/post-merge pipelines, ephemeral QA environments)
- Azure DevOps
- Developer experience tooling (one-touch dev environments, automated onboarding)

## IT & Systems Administration
- Windows AutoPilot (device provisioning)
- Intune MDM (device management)
- Jamf (macOS management)
- Azure Active Directory / Hybrid Azure AD
- Zendesk automation
- PowerShell-based inventory and provisioning systems

## Patterns & Practices
- Strangler-pattern modernization (monolith to microservices)
- No-code platform architecture (schema mapping, configurable transformations)
- Incremental delivery (each phase independently valuable)
- TDD where practical
- Clean architecture
- API-first design
- Multi-tenant system design (250+ integrations)

## Preferred Tools & Working Style
Chase uses Claude Code as his primary development tool for virtually everything — feature work, bug fixes, architecture planning, and creative project management. He prefers TypeScript everywhere when starting from scratch, React + Next.js on the frontend, and Node.js on the backend. He values clean architecture, ships incrementally, and automates everything he can. He's currently deep in AI agent interfaces, exploring what happens when you design systems for AI users instead of human users. He runs Windows 11 as his daily OS and has firsthand experience with the friction points of developing on Windows in a Unix-biased tooling ecosystem.
