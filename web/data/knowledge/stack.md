# Chase's Tech Stack & Skills

## Primary Languages
- **TypeScript** — everywhere, frontend and backend
- **JavaScript** — legacy and quick prototyping

## Frontend
- React (hooks, context, custom hooks)
- Next.js (App Router, SSR, SSG, API routes)
- Angular (professional work)
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui
- Design systems (building and adopting component libraries)
- PWA (Progressive Web Apps)
- Accessibility (WCAG compliance)

## Backend
- Node.js
- Express
- .NET (professional work)
- REST API design
- PostgreSQL
- SQL Server (professional work)
- Azure (Logic Apps, Cosmos DB — professional work)
- AWS (cloud infrastructure)

## AI & Agent Systems
- AI SDK (Vercel AI SDK)
- OpenRouter (multi-model LLM routing)
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- Vector databases (Qdrant)
- Embeddings (Ollama, nomic-embed-text)
- Skill-file architecture (documentation as agent interface)

## DevOps & Tooling
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Cloudflare Tunnels
- Git
- CI/CD
- Developer experience tooling (one-touch environments)

## Patterns & Practices
- Strangler-pattern modernization
- No-code platform architecture
- Incremental delivery (each phase independently valuable)
- TDD where practical
- Clean architecture
- API-first design

## What They Prefer
Chase gravitates toward TypeScript everywhere, React + Next.js on the frontend, Node.js on the backend. They value clean architecture and shipping incrementally. They're currently deep in AI agent interfaces and exploring what happens when you design systems for AI users instead of human users.
