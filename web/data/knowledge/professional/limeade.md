# Platform Modernization & Internal Tooling (Limeade/WebMD)

## The Story
Chase started in IT, automated everything they could, and got pulled into engineering. With a mentor who cared about clean architecture, they learned how to ship in a real product org.

## What They Built
Working with a small team, Chase helped deliver:
- **One-touch dev environment:** Reduced local setup from hours of tribal knowledge to a single command
- **Internal tooling improvements:** Streamlined admin dashboards and internal workflows
- **Design system adoption:** Helped the team adopt and extend a shared component library
- **Strangler-pattern modernization:** Incrementally migrated legacy codebase modules without big-bang rewrites
- **Accessibility improvements:** WCAG compliance work across admin surfaces
- **Performance optimization:** Bundle analysis, lazy loading, render optimization

## Technical Details
- **Stack:** TypeScript, React, Node.js
- **Design systems:** Component library adoption and contribution
- **Architecture pattern:** Strangler fig — wrap legacy modules, replace incrementally
- **Cross-functional:** Worked with design, product, and QA teams

## What Makes This Interesting
The origin story matters: going from IT to engineering by proving value through automation. The strangler-pattern work shows maturity — resisting the urge to rewrite everything and instead modernizing incrementally. The one-touch dev environment shows a focus on developer experience, not just product features.
