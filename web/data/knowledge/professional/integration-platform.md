# No-Code Integration Platform

## The Problem
Partner data arrived in every shape imaginable. Onboarding new integrations required scheduling entire sprints for one-off data mappings — a bottleneck that slowed partner activation.

## The Solution
Chase led a small team building a no-code integration system that lets admins define schemas and transformations through a visual UI. Instead of writing custom code for each partner, the platform abstracts the complexity into configurable workflows.

## Technical Approach
- **Stack:** Angular, TypeScript, .NET, PostgreSQL
- **Architecture:** Modular backend with pluggable data source adapters
- **Frontend:** Admin UI for schema definition, field mapping, and transformation rules
- Started with file-based inputs (CSV, Excel)
- Expanded to timeclock and payroll system integrations
- Laid foundation for API-based no-code integration via workflow automation

## Impact
- Onboarding went from "schedule a sprint" to "ship it this week"
- Reduced partner activation time from weeks to days
- Enabled non-engineering team members to configure integrations independently

## What Makes This Interesting
This wasn't just a CRUD tool — it was a platform shift. The no-code approach meant the engineering team could focus on building features instead of mapping data for each new partner. The system scaled with the business without requiring linear engineering effort.
