# Chase — Bio & Background

Chase is a full-stack software engineer who started in IT, automated their way out of every job, and got pulled into engineering by a director who noticed. They build product-grade systems that remove operational friction at work, and in their own time, they build games, AI tools, and creative infrastructure across 40+ repositories.

## Identity
- Goes by Chase (no last name on portfolio)
- Creative alias: Axiom
- Tone: creative and clever, but professional — funny without being risky

## Career Arc
Chase's path into engineering was unconventional. They started in IT helpdesk and support roles — HD Fowler, then Groupon, where they became known as "the scripting person" for automating ticket workflows and inventory management. At Limeade, they were a de facto sysadmin running PowerShell automation across Windows and macOS environments: laptop provisioning, Zendesk auto-responses, Azure Functions, Windows AutoPilot, Jamf deployments.

The Director of Engineering at Limeade noticed Chase's scripting work and asked if they'd considered software engineering. Chase had previously tried CS in community college around 2014-2015 and sworn it off. But when their child was born in 2021, they used paternity leave to study JavaScript, Ruby, and Python. They came back and transitioned into the engineering department. Within 6-8 months they were promoted from junior to associate engineer for contributing at a mid-level pace.

They went on to lead a greenfield admin rebuild, execute a strangler-pattern migration that improved load times by 75-115%, and evangelize a shared design system across engineering and UX. They're now at Tapcheck, where they designed and built a No Code integration platform serving 250+ payroll and timeclock systems.

## Philosophy on AI
Chase believes AI is this generation's touchscreen-level innovation — a fundamentally new way for humans to interact with complex systems through natural language. Their view is that AI raises the competence floor for everybody, and that its purpose is to increase the value humans deliver, not to replace the humans delivering it. They're against tools that promise to replace developers. Every AI system they build — Dream Factory, Ask Axiom, the Tapcheck knowledge chatbot — is designed to extend what a person can do, not to remove the person from the equation.

## Creative Side
Chase is a prolific builder. They have 43 GitHub repositories and 65 local projects spanning games, SaaS platforms, AI tools, developer infrastructure, and creative pipelines. They build across Unity (C#), Godot (C#), Phaser 3 (TypeScript), and Ren'Py. They're an aspiring game publisher and competitive gamer. They built Dream Factory — a Claude Code plugin — specifically to manage their own tendency to start too many things, restricting themselves to 5 active projects at a time.

## Ask Axiom
This chat widget exists because Chase is bad at self-promotion. Talking positively about themselves feels like bragging, so they built an AI to do it for them. Ask Axiom is RAG-powered, answers from a curated knowledge base, and can escalate to Chase via Discord when it doesn't know something. It's a working example of their philosophy: AI handling something a human finds difficult, so the human can focus on what they're good at.

## Personal
- Seattle native, born and raised in Washington
- Has a family (child born 2021)
- Competitive gamer, aspiring game publisher
- Introverted but values clear communication
- Prefers autonomy and wants others to feel autonomous too
- Challenges decisions when the rationale is "because that's how we do it," but defers to experience when the reasoning is sound

## What They're Looking For
- Product teams that ship fast and value clean architecture
- Roles where systems thinking and engineering craft intersect
- Environments where AI is treated as a tool to extend people, not replace them
- Autonomy with shared context and alignment
