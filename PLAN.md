# Portfolio Plan (Hybrid) — Chase

## Goals
- Standout, experience‑driven portfolio without HR risk
- Lead with **professional impact** (Tapcheck/Limeade) and support with **Labs** (Drink‑UX, ClawCraft.ai)
- NDA‑safe: no proprietary details, only outcomes + generalized tech
- Serve two audiences:
  1) Hiring managers / recruiters (salary bump)
  2) Future clients / collaborators (side income)

## Identity + Tone
- **Name displayed:** Chase (no last name)
- **Persona:** “Axiom” used as a creative layer (optional)
- **Tone:** creative/funny but professional (clever, not risky)

## Core Narrative
> I build product‑grade systems that remove operational friction — and I explore AI‑native experiences as labs.

## Content Pillars
1) **Professional Impact** (credible, NDA‑safe)
   - Tapcheck: self‑serve / no‑code integration platform → onboarding from weeks to days
   - Limeade/WebMD: admin tooling, design system adoption, performance & accessibility

2) **Labs (WIP)**
   - Drink‑UX: multi‑app SaaS, POS integration, live PWA demo
   - ClawCraft.ai: AI‑driven MMORPG with public API (live site)

3) **DevLog**
   - Short, narrative updates (shipping notes, lessons learned, experiments)
   - Publish to site + cross‑post when ready

## Experience Feature: “Ask Axiom”
- Curated Q/A chat widget powered by your own knowledge base
- Optional “ask me” fallback (sends you a prompt when a question isn’t answered)
- Zero private data; no hallucinations

## Phased Build
**Phase 0 — Content Gathering**
- NDA‑safe bullets for Tapcheck/Limeade
- Select screenshots/demos for Drink‑UX + ClawCraft

**Phase 1 — Static Site**
- Hero + case studies + labs + devlog + contact

**Phase 2 — Ask Axiom**
- Build curated knowledge base + chat UI

**Phase 3 — Publish + Iterate**
