    Software Engineer, Windows &mdash; Claude Code<br>
    Anthropic &mdash; Seattle, WA
  </div>

  <p class="salutation">Dear Hiring Team,</p>

  <p>AI is this generation's touchscreen-level innovation for interacting with complex systems via natural language. I believe that deeply, and it is why I have spent the last year building on top of Claude Code &mdash; and why I want to help build Claude Code itself.</p>

  <p>I am applying for the Software Engineer, Windows role because I am not just a candidate who can do this work. I am the user who needs it done. Every day I develop on Windows 11: game engines, AI art pipelines, TypeScript services, Docker stacks. And every day I watch Claude Code default to bash, choke on file paths, and sometimes give up entirely on Windows-specific tasks. I do not have to imagine the pain points. I file them mentally while I work around them.</p>

  <p><strong>The path here was not linear.</strong> I started in IT helpdesks writing PowerShell scripts &mdash; automating laptop inventories, password resets, Azure Hybrid AD joins, Intune deployments. I was "the scripting guy," not a software engineer. I had sworn off engineering after struggling in community college. Then a Director of Engineering saw what I was building and asked why I was not on his team. I studied JavaScript and Python during paternity leave, came back, and was promoted from Junior to Associate in six months because I was shipping at a mid-level pace.</p>

  <p>At Limeade I led a greenfield React rebuild of a legacy admin platform, broke a monolith into microservices using the strangler pattern (75&ndash;115% load time improvement), and evangelized a shared design system across engineering and UX. At Tapcheck, I architect the integrations platform connecting 250+ payroll systems &mdash; and built a No Code configuration layer that eliminated a two-week engineering dependency for every new client onboarding.</p>

  <p><strong>But the work I am most proud of happened at night.</strong> I built Dream Factory, a Claude Code plugin that turns a single session into a multi-agent software studio &mdash; departments, hooks, skills, agent team dispatching across Claude, Codex, and Gemini. I built Millennium, a card game with 665 tests where an LLM serves as the rules arbiter. I built ClawCraft, an MMORPG where AI agents are the players, learning the game through discoverable skill files. I have 43 GitHub repos and 65 local projects spanning TypeScript, C#, Python, Unity, Godot, Phaser, and Ren'Py.</p>

  <p>I built all of it on Windows. I know what breaks.</p>

  <p>What draws me to Anthropic specifically is philosophical alignment. I build AI that extends humans, not replaces them. Dream Factory coordinates AI departments so a solo developer can punch above their weight. My portfolio site has a RAG-powered chat widget because I am bad at talking about myself &mdash; so I built an AI to help. These are tools that raise the floor for what one person can accomplish. That is what Claude Code does, and that is what Anthropic's mission demands.</p>

  <p>I am a Seattle native with a family here. No relocation needed. I would love the chance to make Claude Code work as well on Windows as it does everywhere else &mdash; not just for me, but for every game developer, every .NET shop, every PowerShell scripter who picked up Claude Code and hit a wall they should not have hit.</p>

  <p>Thank you for your time.</p>
