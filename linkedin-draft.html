  <div class="doc-title">LinkedIn Profile Draft</div>
  <div class="doc-subtitle">Reference document for updating LinkedIn &mdash; copy blocks are ready to paste</div>

  <h2>Headline</h2>
  <div class="copy-block">Full Stack Engineer | Developer Tools &amp; AI Systems | Windows, Web, Games</div>
  <div class="note">98 characters. Leads with proven full stack, adds "Developer Tools" naturally, doesn't look tailored for one role.</div>

  <h2>About / Summary</h2>
  <div class="copy-block">I build tools that make people more capable &mdash; not tools that replace them.

My path wasn't traditional. I started in IT support, fell in love with scripting, and forced my way into software engineering when a director noticed I was automating half my job in PowerShell. That background means I think end-to-end: from infrastructure to interface to user.

These days I build across the full stack &mdash; React frontends, .NET and Node backends, Azure serverless, Docker deployments &mdash; and I do most of it on Windows using Claude Code as my daily driver. That combination led me to build Dream Factory, a Claude Code plugin that turns a single session into a multi-agent software studio, coordinating AI departments across art, engineering, and game development.

I think AI is this generation's touchscreen moment &mdash; a fundamentally new way to interact with complex systems through natural language. It raises the sea level for everybody's competence. I build AI that covers a person's weaknesses and extends their strengths: a RAG-powered portfolio chat that handles self-promotion I'm bad at, an internal knowledge chatbot deployed where coworkers already work, a card game where an AI arbiter judges player arguments instead of enforcing rigid rules.

I ship across a lot of domains &mdash; developer tools, web platforms, game engines (Unity, Godot, Phaser), AI pipelines &mdash; because interesting problems don't stay in one lane. I have 40+ repos, 65 local projects, and a self-imposed five-project cap to keep myself honest.

What I bring: fast ramp-up, strong opinions held loosely, and a bias toward building things people actually use. What I'm looking for: hard problems, good teammates, and work that matters.</div>

  <h2>Experience</h2>

  <h3>Tapcheck &mdash; Software Engineer <span class="date">September 2024 &ndash; Present</span></h3>
  <div class="copy-block">Building backend integrations at scale for an earned wage access platform that helps employees avoid predatory payday loans. My team owns the multi-tenant system connecting to 250+ payroll and timeclock systems (ADP, Workday, Dayforce, Viventium Express, and more).

Key contributions:

&bull; Designed and built No Code, an internal integration platform that lets non-engineers create data integrations without a full dev cycle. v1 handled CSV/Excel mapping. v2 added configurable string transformations for edge cases. v3 extended to API-based integrations via serverless workflows. Shifted dozens of integration requests from "needs engineering" to "self-serve," eliminating a recurring 2-week SDLC dependency.

&bull; Building an internal AI chatbot for organizational knowledge &mdash; deployed in Microsoft Teams where people already work. Addresses tribal knowledge gaps and domain knowledge drift that slow down cross-team collaboration.

&bull; Use Claude Code daily for feature implementation, architecture planning, and bug fixes. This hands-on experience directly informed the design of Dream Factory, my Claude Code plugin.

&bull; Drove adoption of Git Flow, split CI/CD into pre/post-merge pipelines, and built ephemeral QA environments for feature isolation &mdash; all without dedicated DevOps support.</div>

  <h3>Limeade &mdash; Software Developer 2 <span class="date">August 2022 &ndash; September 2024</span></h3>
  <div class="copy-block">Full stack development on React micro frontends and .NET Core microservices for an employer wellness platform.

&bull; Led a greenfield rebuild of the admin portal &mdash; replaced a legacy .NET/Knockout.js/jQuery app with React. Trusted with architectural decisions and implementation from day one.

&bull; Executed a strangler pattern migration, breaking features out of a monolith into two microservices. Result: 75&ndash;115% improvement in frontend load times and a measurable increase in admin staff productivity.

&bull; Ran a cross-functional campaign to adopt PrimeReact as a shared design system. Brought developers and UX designers to the table together, solving the recurring problem of Figma handoffs that assumed impossible frontend changes.

&bull; Promoted from Software Developer to Software Developer 2 in ~8 months &mdash; contributing at mid-level pace as a junior.

&bull; Led WCAG AA accessibility compliance work across the React frontend.

&bull; Built automated developer environment setup and comprehensive onboarding documentation to reduce new-hire ramp time.</div>

<div class="page page-break">

  <h3>Limeade &mdash; Software Developer <span class="date">January 2022 &ndash; August 2022</span></h3>
  <div class="copy-block">Transitioned from IT into the engineering department after the Director of Engineering noticed my scripting work and asked if I'd considered software development. Brought system administration instincts into a full stack role &mdash; JavaScript, React, .NET Core, C#, Node.js.

&bull; Proactively designed and shipped usability improvements for the admin tool: data validation, microinteractions, and custom loading states.

&bull; Contributed to WCAG AA accessibility improvements across the React frontend.

&bull; Automated the developer onboarding setup process and authored architecture documentation for new team members.</div>

  <h3>Limeade &mdash; IT Support Specialist <span class="date">March 2020 &ndash; January 2022</span></h3>
  <div class="copy-block">De facto systems administrator managing end-user security, device deployment, and automation across Windows and macOS environments.

&bull; Built PowerShell automations for laptop inventory management, automated password resets via email, and Zendesk auto-response workflows &mdash; earning a reputation as "the scripting person."

&bull; Deployed Windows environments via Azure AD (Hybrid), Intune, and AutoPilot. Managed macOS via Jamf and shell scripting.

&bull; Built a serverless Azure Function API endpoint that saved significant support specialist labor hours.

&bull; This role is where the engineering pivot happened: studied JavaScript, Ruby, and Python during paternity leave, then transitioned into the engineering department.</div>

  <h3>Groupon &mdash; IT Helpdesk Analyst <span class="date">June 2018 &ndash; March 2020</span></h3>
  <div class="copy-block">IT support in a fast-paced tech environment. Managed Zendesk ticketing, hardware provisioning, conference room AV, and Active Directory administration. First job where I started writing scripts to automate repetitive support tasks.</div>

  <h2>Projects</h2>

  <h3>Dream Factory &mdash; Claude Code Plugin <span class="date">Feb 2026 &ndash; Present</span></h3>
  <div class="copy-block">A Claude Code plugin that turns a single session into a multi-agent software studio. Coordinates specialized AI "departments" &mdash; engineering, art/design, game dev, R&amp;D &mdash; using agent teams, skill dispatching, and external engine orchestration (Codex CLI, Gemini CLI).

Built with YAML-driven configuration, bash hooks, and deep integration with Claude Code internals. Manages project manifests, status tracking, department tool catalogs, and cross-engine dispatch protocols.

Tech: Claude Code Plugin SDK, YAML, Bash, Python, JavaScript</div>

  <h3>Millennium: The Living Duel <span class="date">2025 &ndash; Present</span></h3>
  <div class="copy-block">A competitive card game where rules are "common law" &mdash; cards have evocative descriptions instead of explicit rules, and players argue interpretations to an AI Arbiter that adjudicates disputes and builds precedent over time.

v1 complete with first playtest done. 665+ server tests, 34 client tests. Docker deployment (API + React client + Qdrant vector DB for precedent search). Uses LLMs for what they're actually good at: judgment and interpretation, not prose generation.

Tech: TypeScript, Node.js, Fastify, WebSocket, React, Vitest, Docker, Qdrant</div>

  <h3>ClawCraft.ai <span class="date">2025 &ndash; Present</span></h3>
  <div class="copy-block">An MMORPG where AI agents (Claude, GPT, custom bots) are the players, not the NPCs. Instead of a traditional game client, agents learn game mechanics through discoverable skill files (markdown documentation served via curl) and interact through a REST API.

Thesis: skill files delivered via curl are more effective than MCP servers for teaching agents to interact with unfamiliar systems. Live at clawcraft.world/skills.

Tech: TypeScript, Fastify, MongoDB, Vitest, VitePress</div>

  <h3>Ask Axiom &mdash; RAG-Powered Portfolio Chat <span class="date">2025 &ndash; Present</span></h3>
  <div class="copy-block">A portfolio site with an AI chat widget that answers questions about me using retrieval-augmented generation. Built because talking positively about myself feels like bragging &mdash; so I built an AI to do it for me. Includes a Discord bot for human escalation on low-confidence answers and an admin dashboard for knowledge base management.

Tech: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Qdrant, Gemini, Discord.js, Docker Compose</div>
